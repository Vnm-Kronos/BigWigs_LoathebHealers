# BigWigs_LoathebHealers
Allows a raid leader or assist define a healing order for the Loatheb Encounter.
The list will display every healer's timer left on the debuff, and the raid leader/assistant can automatically whisper the next 2 healers to get ready and heal, and also send messages into healerchannel.
Every healer needs to get this addon for it to track their debuff timer.

How to set up an order:
/bwlh rotation Healer1, Healer2, Healer3, Healer4

How to set up a healerchannel:
/bwlh setchannel ChannelName
